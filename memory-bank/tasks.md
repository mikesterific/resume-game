### 🧹 LEVEL 2 TASK: COLLISION DETECTION CLEANUP ⚡ ACTIVE
**Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
**Goal**: Remove all existing collision detection systems to start fresh with our new Phaser collision knowledge

#### Current Collision Detection Analysis ✅
Based on codebase analysis, the following collision detection systems are currently implemented:

**📋 Files Containing Collision Code:**
- `src/game/GameConfig.ts` - Arcade physics configuration
- `src/game/systems/PlayerSystem.ts` - Player physics body setup
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts` - Complex collision system:
  - Player lasers vs enemies overlap detection
  - Enemy lasers vs player overlap detection  
  - Shield collision detection (lasers vs shields)
  - Physics bodies for shields, enemies, lasers
- `src/game/scenes/SkillVillageScene.ts` - Static physics bodies for NPCs/portals
- `src/game/scenes/ProjectForestScene.ts` - Static physics bodies for chests
- `src/game/scenes/ResumeTowerScene.ts` - Static physics bodies for books

**⚙️ Collision Systems to Remove:**
1. **Arcade Physics Configuration** - Keep basic setup but remove collision-specific config
2. **Player World Bounds Collision** - `setCollideWorldBounds(true)`
3. **Laser Combat System** - All laser vs enemy/player overlap detection
4. **Shield Defense System** - All shield collision mechanics
5. **Static Body Creation** - Remove physics bodies for NPCs, portals, chests, books
6. **Physics Body Management** - Remove collision detection for all game objects

#### Implementation Plan 📝

**Phase 1: Core Physics Cleanup (30 min)**
- [ ] Remove collision-specific configuration from GameConfig.ts

**Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT MODE

### 🎯 New Feature: Space Combat Mini-Game (Optional)
- [x] Establish goal: lightweight, optional combat for fun without hurting professionalism
- [x] Add initial foe: enemy ship sprite spawned in Skills Space scene
- [x] Input: Remap docking to `D`; SPACE = hold-to-fire lasers
- [x] Dual parallel lasers from wing mounts; straight ahead, adjustable offset
- [ ] Basic enemy movement/AI (advance/patrol)
- [x] Player projectiles (laser/bullets) with cooldown (SPACE hold-to-fire implemented)
- [x] Collision + simple health system (enemy destroyed on hit; hero hit spawns explosion)
- [ ] Toggle to enable/disable combat in UI
- [ ] Minimal SFX with global sound toggle support

### 🚀 LEVEL 3 TASK: Enemy AI for Space Combat — PLANNING

**Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)

## Requirements
- [ ] Enemy ships move purposefully using simple, readable behaviors (patrol, seek, evade)
- [ ] Enemies respect station shield zones using `ShieldMapManager` (avoid barrier/docking zones)
- [ ] Targeting aims at the player with basic lead or direct aim and configurable fire cadence
- [ ] Support multiple enemies with a lightweight wave/spawn manager
- [ ] Performance-friendly (≤ 10 enemies; steady 60 FPS on HDMI displays)
- [ ] Clean integration with existing combat toggle and UI (non-destructive when disabled)

## Components Affected
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts` (spawn hooks, update loop, collisions, toggles)
- `src/game/systems/ShieldMappingSystem.ts` (read-only use for avoidance queries)
- `src/game/GameEventBridge.ts` (combat enable/disable events)
- `src/game/scenes/GameUIScene.ts` (optional: add Combat ON/OFF control)
- New: `src/game/systems/EnemyAISystem.ts` (core AI behaviors and management)

## Architecture Considerations
- Introduce `EnemyAISystem` mirroring `PlayerSystem` style: pure functions + thin state container
- Behavior-state model: `Idle | Patrol | Seek | Evade | Retreat` with small, composable steering rules
- Shield-aware steering: query `shieldMapManager.getBlockingCollision(position, CollisionLayer.ENEMY_SHIP)` and redirect before barrier penetration
- Scene-agnostic API so future scenes can reuse AI (SkillSpace first target)

## Implementation Strategy ✅ COMPLETE
1) System Scaffold ✅
- [x] Create `EnemyAISystem.ts` with:
  - [x] Interfaces: `EnemyAgent`, `EnemyConfig`, `EnemyState`, `BehaviorState`
  - [x] Defaults: speed, acceleration/drag, turn rate, engagement distances, fire cooldown
  - [x] API: `createEnemy`, `updateEnemy`, `updateAll`, `setTarget`, `setCombatEnabled`, `spawnWave`, `despawnAll`
  - [x] Utilities: steering helpers (seek, flee, arrive), shield-avoidance redirect
- [x] Move existing enemy spawn and enemy firing into the system

2) Scene Integration (SkillSpaceScene) ✅
- [x] Instantiate `EnemyAISystem` in `initializeScene`
- [x] Replace manual enemy group usage with system-managed agents
- [x] In `update()`, call `enemyAi.updateAll(time, delta, player)`
- [x] Wire existing overlaps (player/enemy lasers) to system-spawned sprites

3) Behaviors & Navigation ✅
- [x] Patrol: slow orbit/loop around a patrol point; small noise for variety
- [x] Seek: accelerate toward player with capped turn rate; arrive within min distance
- [x] Evade: if close to player lasers or near shield barrier, steer away and re-path
- [x] Retreat: on low enemy health (if added), disengage briefly before re-entry
- [x] Shield avoidance: pre-emptive redirect on `getBlockingCollision(..., ENEMY_SHIP)`

4) Targeting & Firing ✅
- [x] Aim vector = direct to player; optional simple lead using player velocity
- [x] Fire only if line is not immediately blocked by active shield barrier between enemy and player (coarse step check)
- [x] Stagger fire timers across enemies; burst patterns via jitter around base cooldown

5) Spawning, Difficulty, and Toggles ✅
- [x] Simple wave config: count, spawn radius away from stations, max concurrent cap
- [x] Add combat toggle pipeline:
  - [x] `GameUIScene`: optional "Combat: ON/OFF" control emitting `ui:setting-changed { key: 'combatEnabled' }`
  - [x] `SkillSpaceScene`: listen and call `enemyAi.setCombatEnabled(flag)`; pause firing and AI when off

## Testing Strategy
- [x] Build compiles with zero TypeScript errors ✅
- [ ] Manual test: 1, 3, 6, 10 enemies; verify shield avoidance and stable FPS
- [ ] Verify docking remains blocked only by shields; AI never enters docking radius
- [ ] Verify enemy firing pauses when combat disabled; resumes when enabled
- [ ] Regression: player lasers vs enemy, enemy lasers vs player still function

## Dependencies
- Phaser 3 Arcade Physics (existing)
- `ShieldMappingSystem` (existing)
- `GameEventBridge` (existing)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- Shield avoidance causing jitter: add small cooldown before re-evaluating avoidance vector
- LOS without raycaster: use coarse stepped samples toward player; fall back to fire if uncertain
- Performance with many agents: cap count, reuse sprites, avoid per-frame allocations
- Professional tone: keep effects subtle; default combat OFF for presentations

## Creative Phases Required
- [ ] 🎨 UI/UX Design (not required; optional Combat toggle styling)
- [ ] 🏗️ Architecture Design (covered by this plan)
- [ ] ⚙️ Algorithm Design (minor tuning only; no separate phase required)

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Requirements verified
- [ ] Components listed
- [ ] Implementation steps documented
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Plan integrated in `tasks.md`

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Next Mode**: TESTING & VALIDATION

### ⚡ LEVEL 2 TASK: XP System (Award +10 XP on Enemy Kill) — PLANNING

**Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)

#### Overview of Changes
- Add a global XP counter and lightweight UI display in `GameUIScene`.
- Award +10 XP when a player laser destroys an enemy in `SkillSpaceScene` (single award per enemy).
- Award +50 XP when the player successfully docks with a space station.
- Emit an event via `GameEventBridge` (e.g., `game:xp-changed`) so the UI updates without tight coupling.
- Reset XP on scene start for now; persistence can be a follow-up enhancement.

#### Files to Modify
- `src/types/game.ts`
  - Extend `GameEvents` with `'game:xp-changed': { amount: number; total: number }`.
- `src/game/scenes/GameUIScene.ts`
  - Add an XP text HUD element (top-left under sound/combat), initialize at `XP: 0`.
  - Listen to `game:xp-changed` and update `currentXp` and the text (e.g., `XP: 30`).
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts`
  - In `handleLaserEnemyOverlap(...)`, after confirming `!enemy.getData('isDead')`, emit `game:xp-changed` with `amount: 10` and a running `total` held locally or passed through.
  - In `dockWithStation(...)`, after successful docking completion, emit `game:xp-changed` with `amount: 50`.
  - Ensure only a single emit per enemy by leveraging the existing `isDead` guard.
- `src/game/GameEventBridge.ts`
  - No code change required (event system is generic), but used by both scene and UI.

#### Implementation Steps
1) Types ✅
   - Update `GameEvents` to include `game:xp-changed`.
2) UI Overlay ✅
   - In `GameUIScene`, add `xpText` element and local `currentXp` state; set to 0 on scene boot.
   - Listen to `game:xp-changed` and update `currentXp` and the text (e.g., `XP: 30`).
3) Award on Kill ✅
   - In `SkillSpaceScene.handleLaserEnemyOverlap`, when removing the enemy (after the `isDead` flag is set), emit `game:xp-changed` with `amount: 10` and computed `total` (scene can track a local `xpTotal` and also emit).
4) Award on Docking ✅
   - In `SkillSpaceScene.dockWithStation`, after successful docking animation completion, emit `game:xp-changed` with `amount: 50`.
5) In-Scene Display ✅
   - Add XP text display directly in SkillSpaceScene for immediate visual feedback.
   - Include scale animation and floating text for both kill and docking rewards.
6) Duplicate Protection ✅
   - Rely on existing `enemy.setData('isDead', true)` to guard against double-awards when multiple lasers hit the same frame.
   - Docking XP awarded only once per successful dock (inherent in docking animation completion).
7) Initialization/Reset ✅
   - Reset XP to 0 when `SkillSpaceScene` starts.
8) Optional polish ✅
   - Small scale/color tween on `xpText` when XP increases.
   - Floating `+10` or `+50` text with fade animation.

#### XP Rewards
- **Enemy Kill**: +10 XP per enemy destroyed
- **Station Docking**: +50 XP per successful dock with a space station

#### Potential Challenges
- Multiple lasers colliding with the same enemy in a single frame: handled by `isDead` guard and awarding after the flag is set.
- Multiple docking attempts: handled by existing docking state management (`isDocking` flag).
- Cross-scene consistency: start with per-session XP in scene; persistence or per-scene tallies can be a future feature.

#### Testing Strategy
- Kill a single enemy: XP increments by +10; UI reads `XP: 10`.
- Dock with a station: XP increments by +50; UI updates accordingly.
- Kill multiple enemies quickly: increments correctly with no duplicate awards.
- Dock with multiple stations: +50 XP awarded for each successful dock.
- Toggle Combat OFF: no XP changes while enemies are not being destroyed.
- Hot reload safety: ensure listeners reattach cleanly without doubling.

#### Success Criteria
- Clean TypeScript build; no runtime errors.
- XP visible in UI and reliably increments by 10 per enemy destroyed and 50 per station docked.
- No duplicate XP grants for single events.
- Visual feedback animations work for both kill and docking rewards.

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (Both Kill and Docking Rewards)
**Next Mode**: TESTING & VALIDATION

### 🛡️ New Feature: Space Station Force Shields ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### 🚀 LEVEL 3 TASK: Game Beginning Loop — Shields, Dock, Undock Spawns, Unlock-All — PLANNING

**Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)

## Requirements
- [ ] Player can progress by repeating a clear loop:
  - [ ] Defeat or avoid enemies to approach a target station
  - [ ] Take down the station's shield by firing at it
  - [ ] Dock with the station once shields are down
  - [ ] Undocking spawns +3 additional enemies (per newly unlocked station)
- [ ] Track unlocked stations; consider a station "unlocked" after the first successful dock
- [ ] Repeat loop until all stations are unlocked; emit completion event and show UI message
- [ ] Maintain steady performance (≤ 10 enemies concurrent; 60 FPS)

## Components Affected
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts`
  - Add progression state, unlock tracking, and undock-triggered spawns
  - Add completion detection and light UI feedback
- `src/game/systems/EnemyAISystem.ts`
  - Use existing `spawnWave`/edge spawners; enforce max-enemy cap
- `src/game/systems/ShieldMappingSystem.ts`
  - Read-only: continues to gate docking until shields are down
- `src/game/scenes/GameUIScene.ts`
  - Optional: surface "All stations unlocked" toast and/or subtle guidance
- `src/game/GameEventBridge.ts`
  - New events: `game:station-unlocked`, `game:progress-complete`

## Architecture Considerations
- Progress state lives in-scene (session scope):
  - `unlockedStations: Set<string>`
  - `undockSpawnedForStation: Set<string>` (prevents repeated spawn exploits)
  - `totalStationCount: number`
- Define victory when `unlockedStations.size === totalStationCount`
- Use `EnemyAISystem.setMaxEnemies(...)` to cap concurrent enemies before spawning
- Spawns on undock should be incremental but bounded; prefer `spawnWave(3)` and/or edge spawners for variety

## Implementation Strategy
1) Progression State
   - [ ] Add `unlockedStations` and `undockSpawnedForStation` to `SkillSpaceScene` state
   - [ ] Compute and store `totalStationCount` at scene initialization
2) Unlock on Dock
   - [ ] At end of `dockWithStation(...)`, mark the station as unlocked and emit `game:station-unlocked`
   - [ ] Optional: brief UI feedback in-scene (e.g., "Unlocked: Frontend Station")
3) Spawn on Undock
   - [ ] In `undockFromStation(...)`, if last docked station exists and was not previously spawn-triggered, call `enemyAI.spawnWave(3)`
   - [ ] Record the station in `undockSpawnedForStation` to avoid repeated spawning from the same station
   - [ ] Before spawning, check and respect max enemy cap
4) Rinse and Repeat
   - [ ] The loop continues naturally as player targets new stations
5) Completion
   - [ ] After each unlock, if `unlockedStations.size === totalStationCount`, emit `game:progress-complete` and show a subtle UI message via `GameUIScene`
   - [ ] Optionally pause further undock spawns once complete

## Testing Strategy
- Unit-ish scene tests (extend `SkillSpaceScene.spec.js`):
  - [ ] Unlock: simulate docking flow; verify station id added to `unlockedStations` and event emitted
  - [ ] Undock spawn: verify `spawnWave(3)` called once per newly unlocked station (guarded by set)
  - [ ] Max enemy cap respected when spawning (no overshoot beyond cap)
  - [ ] Completion: when all stations are unlocked, `game:progress-complete` emitted and UI text updated via `GameUIScene`
  - [ ] Non-regression: docking remains blocked while shields active; allowed when down
- AI system: no changes required; reuse existing tests

## Dependencies
- Phaser 3 (existing)
- `EnemyAISystem` (existing)
- `ShieldMappingSystem` (existing)
- `GameEventBridge` (existing; add two event types)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- Enemy pile-up after repeated undocks
  - Mitigate via `setMaxEnemies` and pre-spawn count checks
- Re-docking exploit to farm spawns
  - Track `undockSpawnedForStation` and only spawn once per station
- Player clarity on goals
  - Light, non-intrusive prompt when no stations unlocked yet; brief toast on first unlock and on completion

## Creative Phases Required
- [ ] 🎨 UI/UX Design (optional toasts/hints only; can proceed without a creative phase)
- [ ] 🏗️ Architecture Design (covered by this plan)
- [ ] ⚙️ Algorithm Design (N/A)

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Requirements verified
- [ ] Components listed
- [ ] Implementation steps documented
- [ ] Tests identified
- [ ] Events defined and integrated

**Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE — Ready for Implementation
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT MODE

### ⚙️ LEVEL 2 TASK: Enemy Ships Toggle (Disable Combat) — ✅ COMPLETE

- **Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Goal**: Allow users to completely disable enemy ships and combat. When OFF: no enemies spawn, any existing enemies/lasers are removed, and no combat logic runs. When ON: normal behavior resumes.

#### ✅ Implementation Achievements
- **UI Toggle**: Added "Enemies: ON/OFF" button in upper-right of GameUIScene with visual feedback (red/gray colors)
- **localStorage Persistence**: Setting persists across browser sessions, defaults to OFF for professional presentations  
- **Event Broadcasting**: UI scene broadcasts initial setting before other scenes start, ensuring proper initialization
- **Scene Integration**: SkillSpaceScene tracks combat state and responds to toggle events:
  - OFF: No initial enemy spawns, despawns existing enemies/lasers, prevents undock spawns, skips collision detection
  - ON: Spawns 2 enemies if none exist, enables normal AI and collision behavior
- **Backward Compatibility**: Docking, XP, shields, and all other features work regardless of combat setting

#### ✅ Files Successfully Modified
- `src/game/scenes/GameUIScene.ts`: Added toggle button, persistence, event broadcasting
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts`: Added combat state tracking, spawn gating, toggle response
- `src/game/systems/EnemyAISystem.ts`: No changes needed (existing `setCombatEnabled`/`despawnAll` used)

#### ⚠️ Test Status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Clean (no errors)
- Manual testing needed: Verify toggle behavior, persistence, spawn/despawn timing
- Unit tests: Some failures due to new default behavior (combat OFF), mocking needs updates
- Tests should be updated to reflect new default state and mock new methods

#### ✅ Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Default combat OFF for professional presentations
- ✅ Persistent toggle in upper-right UI
- ✅ No enemies spawn when OFF; normal behavior when ON
- ✅ Docking and XP systems independent of combat setting
- ✅ Clean codebase integration without breaking existing functionality

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR USER TESTING
**Manual Testing**: Toggle button in upper-right, localStorage persistence, spawn/despawn behavior

### ⚡ QUICK FIX: Radar Centering Correction — ✅ COMPLETE

**Issue**: Radar was ship-centered instead of station-centered when docked
**Solution**: Modified `emitEnemyPositions()` to use station position as radar center when docked

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts` - Dynamic radar center logic (station when docked, ship when flying)
- ✅ `src/types/game.ts` - Updated type definition to clarify `playerPosition` is radar center

**Result**: Radar now feels like a proper station-based system when docked at space stations

### 📝 WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT: Always Use NVM for Node.js Commands

**Issue**: `crypto.hash is not a function` error when starting Vite dev server
**Root Cause**: Node.js version compatibility issue with Vite
**Solution**: Always use `nvm use` before running any Node.js commands

**Updated Command Pattern**:
```bash
# Instead of: npm run dev
# Always use: nvm use && npm run dev

# Instead of: npm run type-check  
# Always use: nvm use && npm run type-check

# Instead of: npm install
# Always use: nvm use && npm install
```

**Benefit**: Ensures consistent Node.js version and prevents compatibility errors

### ⚡ LEVEL 2 TASK: Enemy Undock Spawning with Delay — PLANNING

**Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
**Goal**: Move enemy spawning from docking to undocking with a 300ms delay for improved game flow

#### Overview of Changes
Move the existing enemy spawning logic from `dockWithStation()` method to `undockFromStation()` method, adding a 300ms delay before spawning occurs. This creates a more dynamic gameplay experience where enemies appear after the player leaves a station rather than while approaching it.

#### Requirements
- [ ] Enemy spawning occurs on undocking rather than docking
- [ ] 300ms delay between undocking action and enemy spawn
- [ ] Maintain existing spawn count (3 enemies per unlocked station)
- [ ] Preserve existing guard logic to prevent duplicate spawns per station
- [ ] Respect combat enabled/disabled toggle behavior
- [ ] Use existing spawn methods (`spawnFromOutsideRandom(3)` or `spawnWave(3)`)

#### Files to Modify
**Primary Implementation File:**
- `src/game/scenes/SkillSpaceScene.ts`
  - **dockWithStation method** (lines 512-525): Remove enemy spawning logic
  - **undockFromStation method** (lines 532-543): Add delayed enemy spawning logic
  - **Scene state**: Update spawn tracking variable names for clarity

#### Implementation Steps

**Phase 1: Remove Dock Spawning (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Remove enemy spawning code from `dockWithStation()` method (lines 512-525)
- [ ] Keep XP rewards, station unlocking, and radar events intact
- [ ] Update comment about spawning location

**Phase 2: Add Undock Spawning with Delay (20 minutes)**
- [ ] Modify `undockFromStation()` method to include delayed spawning logic
- [ ] Add 300ms timer using Phaser's `this.time.delayedCall(300, callback)`
- [ ] Move existing spawn logic (combat enabled check, spawn count, spawn method selection)
- [ ] Implement station tracking for spawn guards (last docked station reference)
- [ ] Update spawn tracking set name (`dockSpawnedForStation` → `undockSpawnedForStation`)

**Phase 3: State Management and Testing (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Add temporary storage for last docked station ID for undock reference
- [ ] Update scene state interface if needed for station tracking
- [ ] Test docking/undocking flow with enemy spawning
- [ ] Verify 300ms delay timing feels appropriate
- [ ] Ensure rapid dock/undock doesn't cause timing issues

#### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Phaser.js (existing game engine)
- **Language**: TypeScript (existing implementation)
- **Timer System**: Phaser's built-in `time.delayedCall()` method
- **Spawn System**: Existing `EnemyAISystem` methods

#### Implementation Details

**Current Spawn Location** (to be moved):
```typescript
// Lines 512-525 in dockWithStation()
if (this.state.enemyAI && this.state.combatEnabled) {
  const alreadySpawned = stationId && this.state.dockSpawnedForStation?.has(stationId)
  if (stationId && !alreadySpawned) {
    if (typeof this.state.enemyAI.spawnFromOutsideRandom === 'function') {
      this.state.enemyAI.spawnFromOutsideRandom(3)
    } else {
      this.state.enemyAI.spawnWave(3)
    }
    this.state.dockSpawnedForStation?.add(stationId)
  }
}
```

**Target Implementation** (in undockFromStation()):
```typescript
// Store last docked station for undock spawning
const lastDockedStationId = this.state.dockedStation?.getData('stationData')?.id

// Set undocked state
this.state.isDocked = false
this.state.dockedStation = null

// Delayed enemy spawning (300ms after undocking)
if (lastDockedStationId && this.state.enemyAI && this.state.combatEnabled) {
  this.time.delayedCall(300, () => {
    const alreadySpawned = this.state.undockSpawnedForStation?.has(lastDockedStationId)
    if (!alreadySpawned) {
      if (typeof this.state.enemyAI.spawnFromOutsideRandom === 'function') {
        this.state.enemyAI.spawnFromOutsideRandom(3)
      } else {
        this.state.enemyAI.spawnWave(3)
      }
      this.state.undockSpawnedForStation?.add(lastDockedStationId)
    }
  })
}
```

#### Potential Challenges
- **Station ID Tracking**: Ensuring last docked station ID is available in undock method
- **Timer Management**: Preventing timer conflicts if player docks/undocks rapidly
- **State Consistency**: Updating guard set names and maintaining spawn prevention logic
- **Combat Toggle**: Ensuring combat disabled state is respected during delayed spawning

#### Success Criteria
- **Timing**: Enemies spawn exactly 300ms after undocking action completes
- **Spawn Count**: Same 3 enemies spawn per unlocked station as current behavior
- **Guard Logic**: No duplicate spawning when undocking from same station multiple times
- **Combat Toggle**: Spawning respects combat enabled/disabled setting at spawn time
- **Performance**: No timing conflicts or memory leaks from delayed calls
- **User Experience**: Smooth undocking animation followed by enemy appearance

#### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Dock and undock from various stations, verify 300ms delay timing
- **Rapid Operations**: Test rapid dock/undock cycles to ensure no timing conflicts
- **Combat Toggle**: Test spawning behavior when combat is disabled before/during delay
- **Station Variety**: Test with different stations to ensure consistent behavior
- **Edge Cases**: Test undocking without prior docking, scene transitions during delay

**Estimated Total Time**: 40 minutes (down from initial 45 minutes due to clear implementation path)

**Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT MODE
