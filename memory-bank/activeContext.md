# Active Context - Resume Game

## Recently Completed
- **Portfolio Quest Phase 1**: Foundation & Setup + Creative Design phases COMPLETE ✅
- **Archive Created**: [Phase 1 Archive](../docs/archive/archive-portfolio-quest-phase1-20250102.md)
- **Creative Phases**: Theme selection (spaceship exploration), interactive mechanics design, style guide creation
- **Technical Foundation**: Vue 3 + Phaser.js hybrid architecture fully operational

## Current Focus
**SKILLS SPACE SCENE TRANSFORMATION: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED** ✅

**Task Complete**: 🚀 SKILLS SPACE SCENE TRANSFORMATION
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature) - SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Goal**: Transform skills display from forest/village theme to space station orbital layout
- **Assets**: "Five Intricate Space Stations in Orbit.png" strategy implemented
- **Status**: FULLY COMPLETE - Live and functional

**New Initiative (Optional)**: Space Combat Mini-Feature
- Player lasers collide with enemies; explosion shown on impact.
- Enemy fires a single nose-mounted laser straight ahead; hero explosion on hit.
- Current timers: player fire repeat 140ms; enemy fire 800ms; speeds: player 800px/s, enemy 700px/s.
- Next candidates: enemy movement/patrol AI; combat toggle in UI; basic health counters.
- Enemy foe introduced in Skills Space scene (nose-to-nose with hero)
- Controls: `D` = dock/undock/portal, `SPACE` = hold to fire dual lasers
- Lasers: parallel straight shots from wing mounts; tuned tighter spacing
- Constraint: must remain toggleable and non-intrusive for professional view

**Final Implementation Achievements**:
- ✅ **Complete Scene Transformation**: SkillVillageScene → SkillSpaceScene operational
- ✅ **Professional Space Theme**: Industrial space stations maintaining business credibility
- ✅ **8 Color-Coded Stations**: Development, Infrastructure, Innovation Hub sectors
- ✅ **Deep Space Environment**: Starfield background with space command center aesthetics
- ✅ **16px Font Optimization**: Enhanced readability for large display presentations
- ✅ **Docking Interaction System**: Professional "dock to explore" terminology
- ✅ **Cross-Scene Integration**: All portals and navigation updated and working
- ✅ **Performance Maintained**: 60 FPS optimization preserved on HDMI displays

**Technical Quality**: 
- Build Status: ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Dev Server: ✅ Running successfully at localhost:3000  
- All Features: ✅ 8 skill stations, modals, navigation fully functional

**Business Impact**: Successfully delivers engaging space exploration theme while maintaining professional portfolio credibility for business presentations.

**Memory Bank Updated**: All documentation current with implementation details and lessons learned captured.

**Ready For**: New development tasks or production deployment preparation

## Latest Achievement

- [x] **COMPLETE PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION** ✅

## Phase 1 Achievements
1. ✅ Vue 3 + Vite + Phaser.js project setup
2. ✅ Hybrid architecture with event bridge communication
3. ✅ Complete game world with 3 scenes (Skill Village, Project Forest, Résumé Tower)
4. ✅ Full Vue component system (ProjectModal, SkillModal, ResumeModal, ContactModal)
5. ✅ Professional portfolio data structure and sample content
6. ✅ Traditional portfolio view for professional contexts
7. ✅ HDMI-optimized configuration for large displays

## Resolution Complete ✅
- ✅ Node.js upgraded to version 20.19.0 (compatibility resolved)
- ✅ Development server running successfully
- ✅ All Phase 1 deliverables tested and validated

**NEXT**: Begin Phase 2 - Core Game Engine refinement

## Context Notes
- **Project Concept**: "Portfolio Quest" - Retro RPG-inspired interactive portfolio
- **Key Areas**: Skill Village, Project Forest, Résumé Tower
- **Tech Stack**: Phaser.js + Vue 3 + Vite hybrid approach
- **Target**: HDMI-optimized for large screen presentations
- **Balance**: Professional presentation with engaging game mechanics
- **Organization**: Memory bank files organized in `memory-bank/` folder for better project structure

## Key Decisions Made
- Hybrid architecture: Phaser.js for game + Vue 3 for UI
- Vue 3 with Composition API and Vite build system
- Pixel-art aesthetic with smooth animations
- Multi-platform support (desktop, mobile, large displays)
- JSON-driven content for easy updates
- Professional toggles (sound, skip game option)

## Phase 1 Achievements Archived
- ✅ Complete technical architecture implementation
- ✅ Three navigable game scenes
- ✅ Professional UI component system
- ✅ Spaceship exploration theme designed
- ✅ Dynamic solar system interaction mechanics
- ✅ Comprehensive sci-fi style guide created
- ✅ All documentation and lessons learned preserved

## Available for Next Task
System is ready to begin Phase 2 implementation or transition to new development priorities.

**Archive Status**: COMPLETE  
**Task Status**: READY FOR PHASE 2  
**Next Recommended Mode**: VAN MODE (for Phase 2 initialization) or IMPLEMENTATION MODE

## Recent Bug Fix
- **Shield regeneration consistency**: Fixed iteration callbacks that returned `false` inside `Group.children.each`, which stopped processing after the first shield. Callbacks now return `null`, ensuring all shields update and regenerate.
- **Validation**: Added temporary in-scene labels and periodic JSON snapshots; applied one-time `-1 HP` to all shields for visible regen; confirmed uniform behavior.
- **Decision**: Keep a uniform shield config temporarily for testing; restore sector-specific configs after validation if desired.
