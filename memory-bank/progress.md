## Previous Achievement: Enemy AI Perception + Strafe/Orbit ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Feature**: EnemyAISystem — vision, strafe/orbit around hero, lead targeting  
**Status**: Implemented and TypeScript-clean

### Summary
Enhanced enemy ships with lightweight perception and dynamic flight patterns so they can “see” the hero and engage intelligently while respecting station shields.

### Key Changes Implemented
- **Perception (FOV + LOS + Memory)**
  - Added `sensorRange`, `fovDegrees`, periodic LOS checks (`perceptionRecheckMs`) with shield-aware sampling.
  - Stored `lastSeenAt` and `lastSeenTime` for future investigate behaviors.
- **New STRAFE/Orbit Behavior**
  - Introduced `STRAFE` state that blends arrive-to-ring (`orbitRadius`) with tangential motion around the hero.
  - Occasional orbit direction flips to avoid predictability.
- **Shield-Aware Navigation**
  - Pre-emptive avoidance via `ShieldMapManager.getBlockingCollision` and outward avoidance force.
- **Lead Targeting**
  - Enemy lasers aim using single-step lead prediction (hero velocity + projectile speed).
- **Time-Correct Steering/Rotation**
  - Steering acceleration and rotation rates scaled by `delta` for stability across frame rates.
  - Physics bodies use `setMaxVelocity` to cap velocity.
- **Scene Collision Wiring**
  - Player laser → enemy collision handled by a lightweight per-frame check since agents aren’t stored in a Phaser Group.

### Tuning Knobs
- `sensorRange`, `fovDegrees`: how far/wide enemies “see”.
- `orbitRadius`, `strafeSpeed`: positioning and circling speed around the hero.
- `minDistance`, `maxDistance`: engagement band.
- `losSampleCount`, `perceptionRecheckMs`: LOS accuracy vs performance.
- `acceleration`, `drag`, `speed`, `turnRate`: motion feel and responsiveness.

### Performance & Stability Lessons
- **Throttle expensive checks**: LOS sampling runs on a cadence; FOV/range checks every frame are inexpensive.
- **Avoid jitter**: Add a short cooldown (e.g., 200ms) between avoidance redirects to prevent oscillations at shield edges.
- **Cap velocity**: `body.setMaxVelocity` keeps agents within design speed under high acceleration.
- **Delta-based rotation**: Constrain rotation per frame using `turnRate * (delta/1000)` plus `ShortestBetween` for smooth facing.
- **Helper scoping**: Refer to `SteeringHelpers.seek` inside `wander` to avoid `this` context pitfalls.

### Potential Next Enhancements
- **Flocking Lite**: separation to avoid clumping; optional mild alignment.
- **Role Assignment**: pursuer/strafer/flanker roles rotated on a timer.
- **Investigate State**: move to `lastSeenAt` when LOS is lost; timeout back to patrol.

## Latest Major Achievement: Space Station Force Shields ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Feature**: Space Station Force Shield System  
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: LIVE and fully operational

### Force Shield System Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive defensive shield system for all 8 space stations in the Skills Space Scene. The shields provide tactical depth to the existing combat system while maintaining professional presentation standards.

**Core Mechanics Implemented**:
- **Selective Permeability**: Player ships pass through shields for normal docking operations
- **Laser Blocking**: All projectiles (player and enemy lasers) are stopped and destroyed on shield contact  
- **Dynamic Health System**: Shields take damage from hits and can be temporarily disabled
- **Progressive Visual Feedback**: Color transitions (blue → yellow → red) indicate shield degradation
- **Automatic Regeneration**: Shields restore health when not under active fire

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Procedural Graphics**: Dynamic shield texture generation with health-based visual states
- **Physics Integration**: Seamless collision detection using Phaser.js arcade physics
- **Station-Specific Properties**: Each sector has unique shield characteristics
  - Development Sector: 90px radius, 4 health, blue tint, 2s regeneration
  - Infrastructure Sector: 100px radius, 5 health, orange tint, 1.5s regeneration  
  - Innovation Hub: 110px radius, 6 health, purple tint, 1s regeneration
- **Particle Effects**: Hit impacts, destruction bursts, and reactivation animations
- **Performance Optimized**: Maintains 60 FPS with efficient collision detection and cached textures

### Integration Quality

The force shield system integrates seamlessly with existing Portfolio Quest systems:
- **Combat System**: Enhances tactical decision-making without disrupting laser mechanics
- **Docking System**: No interference with station proximity detection or modal interactions
- **Visual Theme**: Professional sci-fi aesthetic maintains business presentation credibility
- **Performance**: Zero impact on frame rate or game responsiveness

### Strategic Impact

This enhancement significantly improves the space combat experience:
- **Tactical Depth**: Players must now consider shield status when engaging targets
- **Risk vs Reward**: Creating openings in defenses requires sustained effort
- **Visual Spectacle**: Professional-quality energy effects enhance the space exploration theme
- **Portfolio Value**: Demonstrates sophisticated game system design and implementation skills

### Lessons Learned (Shields, Regeneration, Iteration)
- **Phaser each() return semantics**: Returning `false` from `Group.children.each` callbacks stops iteration. Returning `null` (or no explicit boolean) ensures all children process. This was the root cause of “only one station regenerates.”
- **Regen visibility requires damage**: Regeneration only occurs after damage and 3s of no hits. For validation, apply a one-time `-1 HP` to all shields or add a debug toggle.
- **Instrumentation accelerates debugging**: Floating shield health labels and periodic JSON snapshots provided immediate clarity on system-wide state.
- **Auto-reactivation details**: When a destroyed shield regens past 0, re-enable visibility and its physics body to restore interactions.
- **Config strategy**: Unifying shield config aids testing; sector-based configs can be restored for gameplay variety once behavior is verified.

## Enemy AI Hunt & Edge Spawns — Lessons Learned

- **Predictive pursuit**: Using arrive-to-predicted target (velocity lead) yields smoother, more reliable chasing than raw seek. Tuning `leadScale` balances responsiveness vs overshoot.
- **Edge spawners**: `spawnFromLeft/Right/Top/Bottom` provide controlled ingress and initial facing toward the hero, eliminating mid-map pop-ins and improving encounter framing.
- **LOS robustness**: LOS now samples shield barriers when a `ShieldMapManager` is present; without it, LOS falls back to in-range checks so AI still functions in scenes lacking shields.
- **Engagement simplification**: EVADE when too close; STRAFE within the engagement band when LOS is present; SEEK otherwise. A wider `fovDegrees` (140°) improves reacquisition.
- **Shield avoidance override**: Periodic, strong outward avoidance (200ms cadence) prevents jitter on barrier edges and keeps agents from getting stuck.
- **Firing model**: Lead-predicted shots retained for consistency while hunting; forward firing cones can be reintroduced if stricter arcs are desired.
- **Time correctness**: Steering force and rotation remain delta-scaled with capped max velocity for stability across frame rates.

Tuning tips:
- **leadScale**: pursuit prediction aggressiveness
- **fovDegrees / sensorRange**: perception envelope
- **orbitRadius / strafeSpeed**: engagement shape
- **turnRate / acceleration / drag**: handling feel
